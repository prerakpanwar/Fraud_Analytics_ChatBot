## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Real-Time Data Streaming**

```python
# Kafka Producer Implementation
def stream_csv_data(file_path):
    producer = KafkaProducer(
        bootstrap_servers="kafka:9092",
        value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode("utf-8")
    )
    # Stream 1500+ transactions with 0.2s delay for real-time simulation
```

### **Machine Learning Pipeline**

```python
# Fraud Detection Model
bundle = joblib.load("fraud_detection_bundle.pkl")
model = bundle["model"]
threshold = bundle["threshold"]

# Feature Engineering
dtype_mapping = {
    "cc_num": "int64", "amt": "float64", "gender": "int64",
    "city_pop": "int64", "age": "int64", "trans_hour": "int64"
}
```

### **AI-Powered Query Processing**

```python
# Natural Language to SQL Conversion
def natural_language_to_sql(query: str) -> str:
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["query", "schema"],
        template="Convert natural language to SQL..."
    )
    chain = LLMChain(llm=self.llm, prompt=prompt_template)
    return chain.run(query=query, schema=self.schema_info)
```

### **Database Schema Design**

```sql
CREATE TABLE fraud_predictions (
    trans_num VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    probability FLOAT,
    is_fraud TINYINT(1),
    full_json JSON,
    feedback TINYINT(1) DEFAULT NULL
