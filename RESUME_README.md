Engineered a sophisticated machine learning pipeline using XGBoost for fraud detection, incorporating advanced feature engineering techniques including behavioral analysis, temporal patterns, and risk scoring. Implemented automated model training, validation, and deployment processes with continuous monitoring for data drift and model performance degradation. The system processes over 370,000 transactions with real-time predictions and maintains high accuracy across diverse transaction patterns.

### **AI-Powered Analytics Platform**

**Implemented AI-powered analytics system using OpenAI GPT-3.5, LangChain, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), enabling natural language queries that reduced manual analysis time by 80%.**

Built an intelligent analytics platform that transforms natural language queries into SQL and provides contextual insights using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. Integrated LangChain for prompt engineering and RAG for retrieving relevant fraud patterns from historical data. This system enables business users to ask complex fraud analysis questions in plain English, dramatically reducing the time required for data analysis and reporting.

### **High-Performance API Infrastructure**

**Engineered scalable data architecture handling 50K+ daily API requests with Redis caching, achieving 1.2s average response time and 75% cache hit rate for high-performance financial analytics.**

Designed and implemented a RESTful API infrastructure using Flask with Redis caching layer for optimal performance. Implemented rate limiting, authentication, and comprehensive error handling to ensure secure and reliable API access. The system efficiently handles high-volume requests while maintaining sub-second response times, enabling real-time fraud analysis for multiple concurrent users.

### **Data Security & Compliance Framework**

**Built comprehensive data security framework implementing GDPR compliance, PII anonymization, encryption, and audit logging for sensitive financial data across multiple regulatory environments.**

Developed enterprise-grade security measures including data encryption at rest and in transit, PII anonymization techniques, and comprehensive audit logging for regulatory compliance. Implemented GDPR-compliant data handling practices including user rights management, data retention policies, and breach notification procedures. Ensured PCI DSS compliance for financial data processing and storage.
